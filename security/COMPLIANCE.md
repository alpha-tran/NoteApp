# Security Compliance

This document outlines the security compliance standards followed by this project.

## Security Frameworks and Standards

### OWASP Top 10

The [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

We maintain compliance with OWASP Top 10 through:
- Regular security scanning (automated and manual)
- Security-focused code reviews
- Developer security training
- Implementing secure coding practices

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Static analysis tools are used to analyze source code and detect vulnerabilities:
- ESLint with security plugins for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Bandit for Python
- Semgrep for multi-language analysis

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

We scan all third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities:
- npm audit for Node.js dependencies
- pip-audit and safety for Python dependencies
- Trivy for comprehensive scanning

### Secrets Management

We follow best practices for secrets management:
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Use of environment variables for configuration
- Pre-commit hooks to prevent secret leakage
- Regular secret rotation

## Compliance Controls

### Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Multi-factor authentication where applicable

### Data Protection

- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Secure data handling procedures
- Data minimization principles
- Proper data disposal methods

### Secure SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

- Security requirements in planning phase
- Threat modeling for high-risk features
- Security testing during development
- Security-focused code reviews
- Pre-deployment security validation

### Incident Response

- Documented incident response procedures
- Regular security drills and tabletop exercises
- Post-incident analysis and learning
- Continuous improvement of security posture

## Compliance Validation

### Automated Compliance Checking

Our CI/CD pipeline includes automated compliance checks:
- GitHub Actions workflow for security scanning
- Pre-commit hooks for early detection
- Required security reviews for critical components

### Regular Audits

- Internal security audits on a quarterly basis
- Annual third-party security assessment
- Continuous monitoring of security posture

## Reporting Non-Compliance

If you identify any non-compliance issues, please report them immediately to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

## Continuous Improvement

Our compliance program is continuously improved through:
- Regular review of security policies and procedures
- Incorporation of new security best practices
- Lessons learned from security incidents
- Feedback from security assessments and audits
