# CI/CD Configuration

This project uses Jenkins Pipeline exclusively for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

The GitHub Actions workflows have been disabled and removed in favor of the Jenkins-based approach.

Please refer to the `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory for the complete CI/CD pipeline configuration.
